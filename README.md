# Adopt-Me! Project

## Introduction

The Adopt-Me website was created using React, vanilla JavaScript, JSX, Babel and Parcel technologies. It calls on the *[PetFinder](https://petfinder.com)* API to find relevant search results depending on location, type of animal, and breed if so desired. This project was made by Scott Katzelnick with the guidance of Brian Holt, a lead software developer at Microsoft, using the *[FrontEnd Masters - Intro To React v5](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/complete-react-v5/)* course. While the video course requires a paid subscription to FrontEnd Masters, the course materials are always available for **free**. More info can be found *[here](https://github.com/btholt/complete-intro-to-react-v5)*.


### Project Goals
  1. Gain a deeper understanding of Reacts newer technologies like Hooks and State by using a mixture of vanilla JavaScript along with common libraries, such as Babel, Parcel, etc.
  2. Solidy my MVC like appraoch to web development by utilizing these newer technologies to emphasize separation of concerns and encapsulation techniques using custom React Hooks.
  3. Give animals a second chance at a great life, with the possibility of getting adopted by helping their stories reach a broader audience.
